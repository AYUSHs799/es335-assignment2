# Assignment 2

Total marks: 

1. Implement momentum [2]
2. `np.linalg.solve` v/s `np.linag.inv` reference lecture on multi-colinearity [1]
3. Sklearn's linear regression code does not suffer due to multi-colinearity. Why? Dive deep into sklearn's linear regression code and explain why [1]
4. Start with instructor's notebook on using RFF on reconstructing images. Use that notebook and show:
    - superresolution [2]
    - completing image with 10%, 20%, .., missing data (random) [1]
    - completing image with rectangular patch missing [1]
5. Use instructor's notebook on matrix factorisation
    - use above image from Q4 and complete the rectangular missing patch [1]
    - write a function using https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.linalg.lstsq.html and use alternating least squares instead of gradient descent [1]
6. Solve the activity recognition problem using RF and linear regression and compare the results to DT. [2]
